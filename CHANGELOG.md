## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-03

### 🎯 Major Features
- **Pull Requests Integration**: New `pullRequestsENT.js` for Pickup/Delivery button functionality
- **IIFE Isolation**: Both scripts wrapped in IIFEs to prevent global variable collisions
- **Cross-Script Compatibility**: maps.js and pullRequestsENT.js now work together without interference

### ✨ Added
- `pullRequestsENT-clean.js` - Clean, production-ready Pickup/Delivery button integration
- `pullRequestsENT.js` - Debug version with extensive mobile debugging overlay
- `pullRequestsENT.min.js` - Minified production version (4KB)
- `maps.min.js` - Pre-built minified version of maps.js

### 🔧 Changed
- Wrapped pullRequestsENT.js in IIFE to isolate variables (`isMobileDevice`, `debugMode`, `processedItems`, `debugLog`, `domReady`)
- Each script now maintains its own local scope preventing overwrites

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Variable Collision Bug**: Fixed issue where pullRequestsENT.js was overwriting maps.js global variables
- Both MapIt (desktop) and Pickup/Delivery (mobile) buttons now work simultaneously
- Call number detection improved for mobile views

### 📱 Mobile Improvements
- Added mobile-specific status element detection
- Document-wide call number search for mobile DOM structure
- Support for non-LC call numbers (e.g., Popular Books collection uses author names)

### 📝 Files for Deployment
- `maps.min.js` - MapIt button functionality
- `pullRequestsENT.min.js` - Pickup/Delivery button functionality (uses pullRequestsENT-clean.js)
